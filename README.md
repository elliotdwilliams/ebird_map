# MyEBird Location Map

This jupyter notebook will guide you through the process of creating map visualizations of the places where you have birded, using data downloaded from [eBird](https://ebird.org/home).

The code is designed to work with a download of eBird data in CSV format.  You can get this data by signing into eBird, and going to [https://ebird.org/downloadMyData](https://ebird.org/downloadMyData).

The notebook uses the Pandas and Plotly python libraries.
